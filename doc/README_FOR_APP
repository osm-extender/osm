Section Management System
=========================

An application written by @robertgauld for the Aberdeen Scouts Active Support Unit.
It is designed to allow easy management of any section within Scouting in the UK, although should require only minor tweaks to allow its use in other countries.

Primerilly it was written to keep track of the things I personally hate tracking:
* Who has earnt which badge
* Who is due a joining in badge
* Information for claiming Gift Aid
* Information for census
* How balanced my pack's programme is


Machine Specific Configuration
==============================
This system requires some setting up specific to the machine you are running it on.
This configuration is stored in the config/machine.yml file, this is created by the setup script.


License
=======
I am still deciding which license to release the code under,
until then if you wish to use this code you will need to gain my permission, which is easily done.
