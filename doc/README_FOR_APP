OSMExtender
===========

An application written by @robertgauld.
It is designed to extend the capabillities of the Online Scout Manager (https://www.onlinescoutmanager.co.uk).

Primerilly it was written to add features that I want but which were not popular enough to make it into the OSM product:
* How balanced my programme is


Machine Specific Configuration
==============================
This system requires some setting up specific to the machine you are running it on.
This configuration is stored in the config/machine.yml file, this is created by the setup script.


License
=======
I am still deciding which license to release the code under,
until then if you wish to use this code you will need to gain my permission, which is easily done.
